Feature 1: File Search

One of the features I added to the Multimedia Web App is a file search functionality. This feature allows users to search for specific files based on their names. It enhances the user experience by providing a quick and convenient way to locate files within a large collection.

To implement this feature, I added a search input field where users can enter their search queries. As the user types, the app filters the file list based on the input and displays the matching files in real-time. The search is case-insensitive, meaning it matches files regardless of capitalization.

I chose this feature because searching for files is a common requirement in file management systems. It helps users locate files efficiently, especially when dealing with a large number of files. By incorporating search functionality, the web app becomes more user-friendly and saves users valuable time that would otherwise be spent manually scrolling through the file list.

Feature 2: File Sorting

The second feature I added is file sorting. This feature allows users to sort the file list based on different criteria such as file name, file type, and file size. Sorting provides users with the ability to organize and categorize their files according to their preferences.

To implement this feature, I added sorting buttons or dropdown menus next to the file list. When a user selects a sorting option, the app reorders the files accordingly. For example, selecting the "Name" option sorts the files alphabetically by their names, while selecting the "Type" option groups the files based on their types.

I chose this feature because sorting files provides users with flexibility and control over how their files are displayed. It allows users to easily find specific files or group similar files together. Sorting also improves the overall user experience by presenting files in a more organized and structured manner.

Code Explanation:

For the File Search feature, I added a search input field in the JSX code, and then implemented a state variable and an event handler to capture the search query. I used the filter method on the myFiles array to filter the files based on the search query and update the displayed file list accordingly.

For the File Sorting feature, I added sorting options in the JSX code, along with state variables and event handlers to track the selected sorting option. I used the sort method on the myFiles array to sort the files based on the selected sorting criteria and update the displayed file list.

Both features leverage React's state management and event handling to provide dynamic and responsive functionality. The search and sorting operations are performed on the myFiles state variable, ensuring that the file list is updated in real-time based on user interactions.
